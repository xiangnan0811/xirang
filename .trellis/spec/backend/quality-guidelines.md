# Quality Guidelines

> Code quality standards for backend development.

---

## Overview

Backend changes should match the existing Go/Gin/GORM style and keep the
security-sensitive server-management domain conservative. Run `gofmt` on edited
Go files. The standard backend gate is `cd backend && go test ./... && go build
./...`; repository CI also has a conservative `golangci-lint` configuration in
`backend/.golangci.yml`.

---

## Forbidden Patterns

- New ad hoc JSON response shapes in handlers. Use the helpers in
  `backend/internal/api/handlers/response.go`.
- Returning nodes, SSH keys, integrations, or executor configs without
  sanitizing sensitive fields.
- Adding routes under `/api/v1` without the correct `AuthMiddleware`, RBAC, and
  ownership middleware unless the route is intentionally public auth/captcha.
- Ignoring database, SSH, file-system, encryption, JSON marshal, or migration
  errors.
- Adding a setting outside `settings.Service`'s registry or reading a dynamic
  setting directly from the environment when an existing registry key exists.
- Adding SQLite-only or PostgreSQL-only schema changes.
- Introducing new dependencies for small helpers that the standard library or
  existing packages already cover.

---

## Required Patterns

- Return API data through `respondOK`, `respondCreated`, `respondMessage`,
  `respondPaginated`, or the error helpers.
- Keep sensitive data encrypted via model hooks and strip secrets from response
  structs. Example: `model.Node.Sanitized()`.
- Validate IDs with shared helpers such as `parseID` and validate user input
  before writes. Keep validation close to the owning handler/service.
- For cross-resource or multi-row writes, use GORM transactions.
- Use `logger.Module` for new structured backend logs.
- Keep docs in sync when changing API routes, models, env vars, migrations, or
  release/deploy behavior. `CONTRIBUTING.md` lists the current doc-sync rules.
- Prefer existing domain services and helpers before adding new abstractions.

---

## Testing Requirements

- Add or update package tests for behavior changes. The repo already has broad
  `*_test.go` coverage under `backend/internal/api/handlers/`,
  `backend/internal/task/`, `backend/internal/alerting/`,
  `backend/internal/dashboards/`, and related packages.
- Handler changes should verify status code and response envelope when feasible.
  See `backend/internal/api/handlers/response_test.go`.
- Database logic should cover both empty-result and error paths. Migration or
  schema compatibility fixes should include focused tests when they are not
  trivially verified by startup.
- Security-sensitive code such as SSH auth, path validation, encryption, RBAC,
  and ownership filtering requires explicit tests for denial cases.
- Before merging backend work, run at least `cd backend && go test ./...`; for
  broader changes also run `cd backend && go build ./...` and `make lint-backend`
  when `golangci-lint` is available.

## Code Review Checklist

- Are route middleware, RBAC permissions, and ownership checks correct?
- Are API responses still using the unified envelope and existing helpers?
- Are secrets encrypted at rest and removed from response payloads?
- Are SQLite and PostgreSQL migrations paired and reversible?
- Are all DB/SSH/file/encryption errors checked and mapped safely?
- Are background workers and goroutines cancelable or shutdown-aware when the
  surrounding package requires it?
- Are docs updated for API, model, migration, env var, or deployment changes?
- Did the change reuse existing packages/helpers instead of duplicating local
  logic?
